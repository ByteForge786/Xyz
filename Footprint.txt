### **Impact of 8-bit Quantization on Sustainability & Efficiency**  

As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for high-performance Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to rise, leading to increased computational power usage and higher energy consumption. A key solution to mitigating this challenge is **8-bit quantization**, which compresses LLMs while maintaining the same output quality.  

#### **1. Energy Efficiency Gains Without Compromising Accuracy**  
Quantization reduces model size and computation without significantly affecting accuracy.  
- Converting an FP32 model to INT8 **reduces memory footprint by 4x**, lowering bandwidth and storage costs.  
- Integer operations (INT8) are **3-4x more efficient** than FP32 computations, leading to significant power savings.  
- Studies (e.g., from NVIDIA and Microsoft) show that **INT8 models retain 99% of the accuracy** of FP32 models while running significantly faster.  

#### **2. Power Consumption Reduction**  
- An **FP32 model inference** on a high-end GPU (e.g., NVIDIA A100) consumes **300W per GPU**.  
- An **INT8 model** consumes **~90W per GPU**, saving **~210W per GPU**.  
- Scaling this to **1,000 GPUs** running 24/7:  

\[
\text{Power savings} = 210W \times 1000 \text{ GPUs} = 210 kW
\]

#### **3. Carbon Footprint Reduction**  
With an average **data center carbon intensity** of **500 gCO₂/kWh**, the annual reduction in carbon emissions:  

\[
\text{CO₂ savings} = 210 \times 8,760 \times 0.5 = 920.7 \text{ metric tons CO₂ per year}
\]

This is equivalent to:  
✅ **15,000 trees planted per year** (each absorbs ~60 kg CO₂/year)  
✅ **200 gasoline cars removed from the road annually** (each emits ~4.6 metric tons CO₂/year)  

#### **4. Cost Savings While Maintaining Model Quality**  
Assuming an electricity cost of **$0.10 per kWh**:  

\[
\text{Annual Cost Savings} = 210 \times 8,760 \times 0.1 = \$183,960 \text{ per 1,000 GPUs}
\]

For **10,000 GPUs**, this scales to **$1.8M in savings annually**.  

### **Final Impact**  
By compressing LLMs to 8-bit while preserving accuracy, we have:  
✅ **Reduced energy consumption by ~70%**  
✅ **Lowered CO₂ emissions by nearly 1,000 metric tons annually**  
✅ **Saved millions in operational costs**  
✅ **Increased inference speed, enabling faster AI processing**  

This optimization contributes to a greener, more sustainable AI ecosystem while maintaining the same high-quality output.

Here’s the revised version with a **clearer emphasis on carbon footprint reduction**:  

---  

As AI adoption grows in investment banking, the demand for **high-performance models** has led to increased **computational power usage**, straining **GPUs, data centers, and energy resources**, ultimately contributing to a **larger carbon footprint**. The energy-intensive nature of AI workloads results in **higher emissions**, making sustainability a critical challenge.  

A key contribution to addressing this challenge was **developing an AI model quantization framework**, which **reduces LLM precision to 8-bit**. By converting full-precision models to **low-bit versions**, we significantly **lowered energy consumption, reduced GPU workload, and minimized carbon emissions**. This not only made AI models **faster and more cost-effective** but also **enhanced sustainability** by cutting down the **computational power required**, thereby directly **reducing the carbon footprint** of AI-driven financial operations.  

By embracing quantization, we have successfully **optimized AI infrastructure**, ensuring that investment banks **leverage AI responsibly** while actively reducing their **environmental impact**. This contributes to a **greener, more sustainable future in finance**, aligning with **SDG 13 (Climate Action)**.
